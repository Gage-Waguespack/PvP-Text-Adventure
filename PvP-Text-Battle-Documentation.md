## Game Structure
This game mainly uses battle loops and displays 
text to the console to create a PvP game. It's very 
linear and loops the StartBattle function for the 
core gameplay.

## The Classes
There is a class for the character that holds all the 
base values for the character, a player class 
that holds the values that only the player use, a game 
class that holds all of the game mechanics and core 
gameplay, as well as a wizard and barb class that 
are based on the character class and are parters for 
the players.

## The Main Functions
The main functions that are used are a StartBattle 
function that, as previously stated, loops the core 
gameplay. There are a few "getters" like GetHealth, 
GetName, GetIsAlive, and some others as well. 
There are some bigger functions such as 
SwitchWeapons, CreateCharacter, ChangeColor, 
and OpenMainMenu as well.
